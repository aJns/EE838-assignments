\section{Implementation steps}

First we have to find the interest points. I do this using the built-in
Computer Vision Toolbox, and its ``detectSURFFeatures'' function.
For putative feature correspondences I created a simple SSD algorithm.

After we have obtained the interest points and putative correspondences, we can
proceed to use the RANSAC algorithm to try and find the inlier matches. 
First we randomly select 4 correspondences. We check them for collinearity; If
they are collinear, we randomly select another 4 correspondences, until we find
4 correspondences that aren't collinear.

We calculate a homography from the correspondences using the normalized DLT
method. We then count how many of the correspondences conform to this
homography. The conformance is calculated by transforming a point from a
correspondence pair by the homography, and calculating the distance to the
actual second point, and vice verse, and summing the distance. This is also
called a symmetric transfer error. For the inlier calculation I use a distance threshold
of 450. We also calculate the standard deviation of distances.

We then compare the number of inliers to the previous best; If we have more
inliers, the current homography and number of inliers is recorded as the best.
In the special case where the inlier count is the same as the previous best but
the standard deviation of distances is better, ie.\ smaller, we record that as
the new best result. At the end of the cycle we calculate a new N, which is the
number of iterations to calculate.

After the RANSAC algorithm has finished we should have a homography that
performs decently. However, we also use the recorded inliers to calculate the
optimal homography using the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm to minimize the
error.


\section{Results}

The results varied quite a bit, which I guess is somewhat expected due to the
iterative nature of RANSAC\@. Still, there was considerable variance between
runs.

The parameter with the biggest influence on results was the distance threshold.
Smaller thresholds usually come up with the best results, but they were also
far more unstable. Larger thresholds were more stable, but never gave any
really good results.

Choosing the threshold also seems to be dependent on the quality of the feature
extractor; Features from a bad extractor have more outliers, and thus it's
preferable to have a smaller threshold. And vice versa with a good extractor.
Unfortunately, it also seems that the threshold needed to be selected according
to the picture pair, which is quite undesireable behaviour.

Table~\ref{tab:homographies} contains the resulting homographies for both image
pairs.
