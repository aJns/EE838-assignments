\subsection{Line equation}

If the normal vector is (a,b) and given a point (c,d), the line equation is
\(a(x-c) + b(y-d)=0\)


\subsection{Matrix properties}

-We have to know the DoF and rank of every matrices and why

\subsubsection{Homography matrix}
H has 8 degrees of freedom because it's defined up to scale.
2 for scale, 2 for rotation, 2 for translation, 2 for ``line at infinity'' to
finite. Has rank 3.

\subsubsection{Isometry matrix}
Has 3 DoF, 1 rotation, 2 translation

\subsubsection{Similarity matrix}
4 DoF, 1 scale, 1 rotation, 2 translation

\subsubsection{Affine matrix}
6 DoF, 2 scale, 2 rotation, 2 translation

\subsubsection{Fundamental matrix}
Has 7 DoF. 1 DoF is subtracted because it's defined up to scale, 1 because it's
a rank 2 matrix. Because F is singular, it can't be of rank 3. Because it
represents a mapping from a 2d to a 1d projective space, it has to be of rank
2.

\subsubsection{Essential matrix}
The essential matrix has 5 DoF. It's a product of the camera translation and
rotation matrices, which bot have 3 DoF. However, there's scale ambiguity, thus
E has only 5 DoF. E has rank 2, because it is constructed from the translation
matrix, which has rank 2.

\subsubsection{Camera (projection) matrix, and its parts}
A \textit{general} projective camera has rank 3, and 11 DoF.
``
The rank 3 requirement arises because if the rank is less
than this then the range of the matrix mapping will be a
line or point and not the whole plane; in other words not
a 2D image.
''
P has 11 DoF, 5 for K (intrinsic params), 3 for \textbf{t} (translation
vector), 3 for R (rotation matrix).
